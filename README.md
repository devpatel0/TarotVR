# Tarot VR - Team Axolotl
VR Group Project made in Unity with C#. Developed for Oculus Quest 2. COMP 3500, University Massachusetts Lowell

Project Description:
Our project, TarotVR, gives you a real tarot experience. From a card shuffle programmed to give each user a fortune unique to their own to stepping into its reality. Once into our world, a deck of tarot cards is shuffled to give you a reading. Once the shuffling is over your chosen card will be hovering in front of you. This card is interactable, so once you grab it a portal appears but be careful not to let go of the card, because no card means no portal. Once you step into this portal you will enter a room unique to the card you're holding. The room can show the meaning behind the card and its different components.
